Come watch the town hall with local supporters, and start building community around Pete's vision for our country's future. \n\nMayor Pete may appear to be a long shot, but so were the 44th and 45th occupants of the White House. A Midwesterner talking about the future of the workforce in the face of automation, the business reality of climate change, who enjoyed 80% voter support in conservative South Bend, Indiana's 2016 mayoral race, is an Afghanistan Veteran, and a  Rhodes Scholar is really worth the listen. \n\nWe're all excited that Pete will have the opportunity to introduce his vision to a wider audience during this town hall. Now we need to make sure he can get to the debate stage, too. The DNC recently announced a candidate will need 65,000 donors in order to qualify for the first candidate debate in June.

He's as \"un-Trump\" as they come - a mature and completely original voice from a new generation that, unlike the numerous candidates in their 60s and 70s who over the last 40 years led American into the predicaments we now find ourselves, has a first-hand stake in the next 50 years of America, and an aspiring vision that will challenge all Americans to consider what's possible for what he calls the \"post-Reagan-consensus\" era that we're now entering.\n\nThe announcement event will be shown at our home, live-streamed from South Bend, Indiana.  Interested folks are welcome to join us.  We'll serve some \"brunch-esque\" nibbles.

The asphalt can be considerably hotter than the air temp, harming their pads.\n* Do NOT engage with the anti-LGBTQ protesters near the cathedral, they video the confrontations and use the clips to hurt LGBTQ rights. #BeLikePete\n* No alcohol may be consumed while participating in the parade.\n* Only parade vehicles may be driven into the park.
